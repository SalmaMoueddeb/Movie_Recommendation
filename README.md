# ðŸŽ¬ Movie_Recommendation
This project is a simple yet effective movie recommendation system built using the MovieLens dataset. It showcases two core recommendation approaches: content-based filtering using TF-IDF and collaborative filtering based on user ratings.

# ðŸš€ Features
**Data Cleaning:** Extracted release years and cleaned movie titles to remove special characters.

**Content-Based Recommendation:**
Used TF-IDF vectorization on movie titles (including unigrams and bigrams) to enable smart search and suggest similar movies.

**Collaborative Filtering:**
Recommended movies based on user behavior, using rating patterns from similar users.

**Interactive Search:**
Built with ipywidgets to allow users to type a movie name and receive recommendations in real time.

# ðŸ§° Technologies Used
**Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

NLP with TfidfVectorizer

Jupyter Notebook

ipywidgets for interactivity
